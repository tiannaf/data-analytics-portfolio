My name is Tianna, and I am a healthcare data analyst. 

I have expertise gathering, organizing, and

tools and technologies. I have a thorough understanding of data
analytics approaches including dashboard building/design, report
writing, statistics, and critical thinking. I am also proficent in
Python, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, as well as experience in SQL and R.
I currently work in the healthcare omnichannel marketing space and am

I've included a range of my favorite projects that highlight my data analytics
abilities in my portfolio. Links to the dashboards and reports I've
